# Consumer Tech Sample

A Spring Boot reference architecture demonstrating GitHub Actions and Harness CD best practices for Kubernetes, featuring comprehensive security scanning, blue/green and canary deployments, and ServiceNow change management integration.

## Overview

This project serves as a reference implementation for teams adopting Kubernetes using modern CI/CD practices.

## Architecture

### CI Pipeline (GitHub Actions)

The CI pipeline consists of 4 sequential jobs:

1. **Build** - Maven build, SBOM generation, Docker build and push to DockerHub
2. **Scan** - Gitleaks secret detection, Snyk container scanning
3. **Sign** - Triggers Harness pipeline for artifact signing (Cosign)
4. **Notify** - Triggers main Harness deployment pipeline

### CD Pipeline (Harness)

The Harness pipeline includes:

- **Audit Stage** - Creates Jira ticket for tracking
- **Security Stage** - Code quality, SCA, SAST, and container image scans with OPA policy enforcement
- **Deploy to UAT** - Blue/Green deployment with release verification and QA testing
- **ServiceNow Approval** - Change request workflow
- **Deploy to Prod** - Canary deployment with automated rollback capabilities
